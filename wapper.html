        <h1>NATURE'S BEAUTY</h1>
        <p>
          <br>“A flower does not use words to announce its arrival to the world; it just blooms.”– Matshona Dhliwayo.
“A rose can never be a sunflower, and a sunflower can never be a rose. All flowers are beautiful in their own way, and that's like women too.”– ...
“In joy and in sadness, flowers are our constant friends.”
<br>It's not a special occasion, but you're a special person.
Every time you see these blooms, remember I'm thinking of you.
I hope your day is sunshine and flowers!
Just because I love you!
Smile bright! <br>Thus flower is a shoot bearing sporophyll. Flowering plants have successfully colonised land by reducing the water dependent gametophytic generation to the point where it is entirely protected within the sporophytic generation.

Typically flower is a condensed branch in which internodes have become condensed, bringing the nodes close to one another, and the leaves are modified to form floral whorls that directly or indirectly participate in the process of reproduction. Flowers differ considerably in size, shape, colour and arrangement of their parts, yet most of them bear a common structural plan.
My favourite flower is the rose. It is known as the flower of love across the world. Roses can be found in different colours like red, white, pink, yellow, etc. The rose petals are soft and delicate. Roses grow on shrubs and have little thorns on their stems. The leaves of the rose plants are generally round and deep green.
